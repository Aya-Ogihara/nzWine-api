## Objective
* For the server-side component of a “New Zealand wine” web application.
* The web application will provide users with access to information about different
New Zealand wine regions and wines.

* For the front end, React is used for an application called nzWine based on
its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to receive information on New Zealand wine regions, and New Zealand wines so that I can learn more about New Zealand wines I’ve tested or am interested in.
